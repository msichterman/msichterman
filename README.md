Hey there 👋🏻 , my name is Matt and I am an incoming senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Software Engineering. I am also an offensive lineman on the football team. When I am not working out on the field or in the weight room, I am working hard to better myself as a software engineer.

As a software engineer, I enjoy working on full-stack projects. I specialize in JavaScript and enjoy using React, Express, Node.js, NoSQL databases and AWS to create projects. I also have experience using Python, .NET Core and SQL databases. I am currently interested in Gatsby.js and the Serverless Framework.
