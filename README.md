Hey there üëãüèª , my name is Matt and I am a graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln pursuing my Masters in Engineering Management, where I got my bachelors degree in Software Engineering. I am also a former offensive lineman for the Nebraska football team.

As a software engineer, I enjoy working on full-stack projects. I specialize in JavaScript and enjoy using React, Express, Node.js, NoSQL databases and AWS to create projects. I also have experience using Python, .NET Core and SQL databases. I am currently interested in Supabase.
