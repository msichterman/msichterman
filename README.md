### Hello there 👋
My name is Matt, and I work remotely from Cincinnati, OH. I graduated from the 🌽 University of Nebraska-Lincoln 🌽 with a degree in Software Engineering and a Masters degree in Engineering Management. I am also a former offensive lineman for the Nebraska football team 🏈.

Here are some things that I like to do in my free time...
- **Code! 👨🏼‍💻** – Learning is a passion of mine, and I love dabling in new technologies on side projects whenever possible. Lately I've been playing around with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/).
- **Listen! 🎵** – I love podcasts and I am always catching up on episodes of [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com/) or [Startups for the Rest of Us](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/).
- **Watch! 📺 🏈** – I watch a lot of YouTube (lately [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg), [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen) and [Jack Herrington](https://www.youtube.com/c/JackHerrington)), and casually some shows on Netflix, etc. I am also a huge sports fan!
- **Play!⛳️ 🏀 🎮** – Mostly sports, sometimes video games. I have been an athlete all my life! I enjoy working out, playing golf, and recently got back into playing basketball competitively.
