### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt Sichterman and I am an entrepreneur and Sr. Software Engineer at [Flamel.ai](https://flamel.ai/). Flamel.ai is a software platform that enables multi-location brands and agencies to create meaningful engagement and conversion with local, personalized social media content while preserving brand integrity.

I returned to Cincinnati in 2021 after attending the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where [I played football for the Cornhuskers and studied Software Engineering](https://youtu.be/pPqnZ709VG0?si=saZN0eoBLYSAdhqQ). I also earned my Master's degree in Engineering Management with a focus on Business Administration.

My career began in sports tech at Hudl, optimizing user engagement for the AI-enabled, autonomous camera product line, [Hudl Focus](https://www.hudl.com/products/focus). At Hudl, I contributed to mobile applications, web applications, a handful of hardware products, and more.

I then transitioned to American Express, working on the Consumer products (Platinum Card, Gold Card, etc.) team. I deployed full-stack user experiences to tens of millions of customers, focusing on security, performance, accessibility, and UX at scale.

In my spare time, I [co-founded a beef jerky company called "Jurgy"](https://jurgy.co) with my best friend/college teammate/Philadelphia Eagle, [Cam Jurgens](https://www.instagram.com/beef_jurgy/). At Jurgy, we're on a mission to create the best beef jerky in the world. I also enjoy lifting weights, playing/watching sports, traveling around the world, and finding new rabbit holes to continue my lifelong quest of learning and creating.
